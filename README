Monkeysign: OpenPGP Key Exchange for Humans
===========================================

monkeysign is a tool to overhaul the OpenPGP keysigning experience and
bring it closer to something that most primates can understand.

The project makes use of cheap digital cameras and the type of bar
code known as a QRcode to provide a human-friendly yet still-secure
keysigning experience.

No more reciting tedious strings of hexadecimal characters.  And, you
can build a little rogue's gallery of the people that you have met and
exchanged keys with!

Monkeysign was written by Jerome Charaoui and Antoine Beaupré and is
licensed under GPLv3.

Requirements
------------

The following Python packages are required for the GUI to work.

 * python-qrencode
 * python-gtk2
 * python-zbar
 * python-zbarpygtk

If they are not available, the commandline signing tool should still
work but doesn't recognize QR codes.

Of course, all this depends on the GnuPG program.

Installing
----------

To install monkeysign, run:

    setup.py install

There is also a Debian package available.
