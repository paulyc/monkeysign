monkeysign (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * this patch releases fixes critical issues...
  * reported in the Debian BTS:
    * encode prompt properly before prompting (closes: #771032)
    * try to handle error when import actually works in GTK UI
      (closes: #770900)
    * improve debugging by wrapping all writes to gnupg in debug
    * use the proper index when selecting key to sign
      (closes: #771034)
  * reported on the Monkeysphere mailing list:
    * hotfix: properly verify the image signature file
    * hotfix: disable scrolling in qrcode window
    * don't try to remove non-existent video device, and clarify error
      message
    * output --version to stdout and don't make it an error
  * those fix FTBS issues:
    * fix tests after cd4e18c: guess encoding properly
    * update zack's key so tests succeed again

  * and this makes sure this package will be easier to support for the
    lifetime of jessie
    * improve error handling again: distinguish different failure cases
      and clearly transmit GPG errors

monkeysign (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * new features:
    * implement qrcode image import, to allow people without webcams to
      import pictures from a trusted camera - the images must be signed with
      a detached signature on pain of a ugly warning with instructions.

    * udate french translation
  * usability improvements:
    * interface simplified: only the qrcode and webcam with instructions
    * all options moved to menus, including the print/save buttons, the
      video and identity dropdowns
    * properly handle exceptions in gtk UI
    * avoid duplicate camera listing and display nicer name (Closes: #718796)
    * create a set of mockups for a UI redesign and API documentation
      rendered at http://monkeysign.readthedocs.org/

    * fix "Content-description" to be more useful (Closes: #723677)

    * add debugging info from smtp connection, thanks to Gabriel Filion
      (Closes: #756540)
    * some improvements were done in the GnuPG library to work around
      certain GnuPG corner cases and describe problems better
    * install monkeyscan command as a symlink properly (Closes: #743150)
  * switch to long term support strategy for the 2.0.x release in
    preparation for Debian Jessie
